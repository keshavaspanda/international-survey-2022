# AI for Education Survey

The AI for Education (AI4E)  Survey is a survey conducted
by the BITS [Work Integrated Learning Program](https://bits-pilani-wilp.ac.in/) since 2024 and now comprises  Hyderabad, Pilani, Goa, Mumbai and Dubai campuses
and covers all aspects of the practice of STEM Learning.

We ran the **first survey in 2024**, which provided an insight into the
demographics, job satisfaction, and practices of teachers and research faculty
(TRF) in the BITS ecosystem. To support and broaden this work, the institute will conduct the survey at regular intervals and extend the geographical coverage to
facilitate inter-country comparisons. The results of the surveys, anonymised
and open licensed, will act as a a valuable resource to
understand and improve the use of AI and therefore the working conditions for TRFs.

We thank our partners and faculty members who made this survey effort possible.


This site covers the **2024** survey results.

## Composition of the survey

The [base questions](https://github.com/keshavaspanda/international-survey/blob/master/survey_creation/2018/questions.csv) for the survey were tailored to meet the requirements of each country. They covered ten subjects:
   1. **Demographics**: traditional social and economic questions, such as gender, age, salary and education.
   1. **Coding**: how much code do RSEs write, how often, and for whom.
   1. **Employment**: questions about where RSEs work and in which disciplines.
   1. **Current contract**: understanding stability of employment by questioning the type of employment contract RSEs receive.
   1. **Previous employment**: understanding routes into the profession the reasons for choosing it.
   1. **Collaboration and training**: who RSEs work with, how many people they work with, and the training they conduct.
   1. **Publications**: do RSEs contribute to publications and are they acknowledged?
   1. **Sustainability and tools**: testing, bus factor, technical handover. Also which tools they are using
   1. **Job satisfaction**: what do RSEs think about their job and their career?
   1. **Network**: how do RSEs meet and gain representation?
These subjects are not necessarily  investigated under this order, neither published with that order.
